The friendly Operating System for IoT!

RIOT is a real-time multi-threading operating system that supports a range of
devices that are typically found in the Internet of Things (IoT): 
8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, real-time
capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API access,
independent of the underlying hardware (this API offers partial POSIX
compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community).
RIOT is licensed with LGPLv2.1, a copyleft license which fosters
indirect business models around the free open-source software platform
provided by RIOT, e.g. it is possible to link closed-source code with the
LGPL code.


## FEATURES

Added support for BSP for Decawave on RIOT for Nordic NRF52840 and STM32F401RE Nucleo
platform.

Added support for DecaRange RTLS ARM Application

## Dependent tools to used for Nordic board

* To flash the binary JLink is use, please install the tool manually from
https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink.
* Expand J-Link Software and Documentation Pack and select the suitable 
package and click download.
* Double click on the downloaded package to install.


## GETTING STARTED

There is a shellscript in `riot-dw1000` called `build_setup.sh` which
you can use to install all the required packages.
*  To initialize the Environment Variables, installing Dependent Libraries (First time), setup(clone the RIOT repo and sym link creation for dw1000) and building the application
    * Inside the cloned repo,run the script – `./build_setup.sh INITIAL`
*  To initialize the Environment Variables, setup(clone the RIOT repo and sym link creation for dw1000) and building the application(Next Time on Wards)
    * Inside the cloned repo,run the script – `./build_setup.sh Update`
*  To build the DecaRange RTLS ARM application
    * Inside the cloned repo run the script – `./build_setup.sh`
## Hardware setup
The Connection Details of the Hardware setup is explained in [Hardware_setup.md][HS].

[HS]: ./DW1000/DOC/Hardware_setup.md


### USING THE RTLS ARM Application

* Command to build
    ```bash
     $ make -C RIOT/examples/dw1000_rtls_arm BOARD=HW_PLATFORM
    ```
     * For Nordic - HW_PLATFORM = nrf52dk 
     * For NucleoF401RE - HW_PLATFORM = nucleo-f401
     * For Example: `make -C RIOT/examples/dw1000_rtls_arm BOARD=nrf52dk`    
* Command to build and flash
    ```bash
     $ sudo make -C RIOT/examples/dw1000_rtls_arm BOARD=HW_PLATFORM flash
    ```
   * For Nordic - HW_PLATFORM = nrf52dk 
   * For NucleoF401RE - HW_PLATFORM = nucleo-f401
   * For Example: `sudo make -C RIOT/examples/dw1000_rtls_arm BOARD=nrf52dk flash`    

### USE-CASES OF THE RTLS ARM Application
1) Tracking:
The tracking use-case is explained in [Tracking.md][Tracking].
[HS]: ./DW1000/DOC/Tracking.md

#### KNOWN ISSUES

* Tracking Use case
Observed Anchor to anchor bias corrected range(ma), Tag to anchor bias
corrected range(mc) and Tag to anchor raw range(mr) range deviation is between 25-40 cm instead of 15cm for all modes randomly.
* Navigation Use case
Observed that T0 to A0, A1, A2 Range info is detected as 0 randomly
* Geo-Fencing Use case
Log Pattern is not proper as expected: A0:T0, A0:T1, A0:T0 & A0:T2 instead of
A0:T0, A0:T1, A0:T2 for all modes. In case of Mode 3, this is observed occasionally

#### Known Limitations

  Due to EVB 1000 Hardware constraints with External Microcontroller
	    
  * Range Distance Estimation is displayed on PyTerm Terminal
  * Selection of Mode(Mode-1/2/3/4), UNIT(Tag/Anchor) and UNIT ID (0 to 2) is
    configured in DecaRange RTLS ARM Application based on User Input

## DOCUMENTATION

* Userguide is available in DW1000/doc/PP_DecaWave_BSP_ReleaseNotes.pdf
* ReleaseNote is available in DW1000/doc/PP_DecaWave_BSP_UserGuide.pdf
